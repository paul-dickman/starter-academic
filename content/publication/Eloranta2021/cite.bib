abstract = {Abstract Monitoring survival of cancer patients using data collected by population-based cancer registries is an important component of cancer control. In this setting, patient survival is often summarized using net survival, that is survival from cancer if there were no other possible causes of death. Although net survival is the gold standard for comparing survival between groups or over time, it is less relevant for understanding the anticipated real-world prognosis of patients. In this review, we explain statistical concepts targeted towards patients, clinicians and healthcare professionals that summarize cancer patient survival under the assumption that other causes of death exist. Specifically, we explain the appropriate use, interpretation and assumptions behind statistical methods for competing risks, loss in life expectancy due to cancer and conditional survival. These concepts are relevant when producing statistics for risk communication between physicians and patients, planning for use of healthcare resources, or other applications when consideration of both cancer outcomes and the competing risks of death is required. To reinforce the concepts, we use Swedish population-based data of patients diagnosed with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon and chronic myeloid leukaemia. We conclude that when choosing between summary measures of survival it is critical to characterize the purpose of the study and to determine the nature of the hypothesis under investigation. The choice of terminology and style of reporting should be carefully adapted to the target audience and may range from summaries for specialist readers of scientific publications to interactive online tools aimed towards lay persons.},
