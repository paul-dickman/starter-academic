# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "In this talk I will give an introduction to flexible parametric survival models (Royston−Parmar models) and present several examples of how I use them in my research in cancer epidemiology. The talk is targeted at epidemiologists with a basic understanding of survival analysis (i.e., familiar with the Cox model). I didn’t develop flexible parametric survival models, but I am an avid fan. Some of my methods research (with Paul Lambert and others) has involved extending flexible parametric models. I'll give some examples of how and why I think these models are useful."
