I have co-authored, with Enzo Coviello, Stata commands for estimating and modelling relative survival. Enzo is responsible for all of the nice code.

- [**strs**](/software/strs/) - estimating and modelling relative survival
- [**stnet**](/software/stnet/) - estimating relative survival

Some [Stata tutorials](/software/stata/), most of which are about survival analysis

SAS code for [estimating and modelling relative survival](/software/sas/). I wrote this code in the 1990s and have since moved from SAS to Stata, so this code is not maintained.

Some [SAS tips and tricks](/software/sastips/) (primarily on data management)
