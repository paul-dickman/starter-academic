I have taught courses in England and Italy each summer for over 15 years. I will not teach these courses during 2021, but hope to return in 2022. 

- 1-6 June 2020: ~~Paul Lambert and I will teach a 1-week course on [Statistical methods for population-based cancer survival analysis](https://www.cansurv.net/) in Veneto, Italy.~~ Our course at the summer school cancelled due to covid-19 for both 2020 and 2021. We hope to return in 2022. Some courses at the summer school may be held digitally in 2021, but not our course.

- 13-17 July 2020: ~~I will be teaching at the course [Cancer Survival: Principles, Methods and Applications](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/study/courses/short-courses/cancer-survival) at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.~~ Course cancelled due to covid-19 for both 2020 and 2021. We hope to return in 2022.

I wrote a [blog post](/post/comparison-of-cancer-survival-courses/) comparing the courses at the Veneto summer school and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
