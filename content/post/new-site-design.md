This weekend I redesigned my site using the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). My website has been online since 1998, and the last update to the design was in 2004 so it was long overdue. The old site contained over 6,000 files whereas the new site now has less than 500 files (of which 250 are files dumped in my [teaching download directory](/survival/)). I'm impressed with Hugo Academic. The new design has motivated me to update the content; I've written a couple of tutorials and tried my had at writing a blog post. It will be interesting to see how long the enthusiasm lasts.
