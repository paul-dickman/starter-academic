# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: This weekend my website got a long-overdue redesign. The last one was in 2004. I'm looking forward to working with the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

In March 2019 I redesigned my site to use the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). My website has been online since 1998, and the last update to the design was in 2004 so it was long overdue. The old site contained over 6,000 files whereas the new site now has less than 500 files. I'm impressed with Hugo Academic. The new design has motivated me to update the content; I've written a couple of tutorials and tried my had at writing a blog post. It will be interesting to see how long the enthusiasm lasts.

Update March 2021: Updated to use the academic theme in [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/).
